#The V$PGASTAT view provides instance-level statistics about PGA memory usage and the automatic PGA memory manager.
	SELECT * FROM V$PGASTAT;

	
#The V$PROCESS view contains one row for each Oracle process connected to the database instance. Use the following columns in this view to monitor the PGA memory usage of these processes:	
	SELECT program, pga_used_mem, pga_alloc_mem, pga_freeable_mem, pga_max_mem FROM V$PROCESS;
	

#The V$PROCESS_MEMORY view displays dynamic PGA memory usage by named component categories for each Oracle process. This view contains up to six rows for each Oracle process, one row for:
	SELECT * FROM V$PROCESS_MEMORY;

	
#The V$SQL_WORKAREA_HISTOGRAM view shows the number of work areas executed with optimal, one-pass, and multi-pass memory size since instance startup. Statistics in this view are divided into buckets. The buckets are defined by the optimal memory requirements of the work areas. Each bucket is identified by a range of optimal memory requirements, specified by the values in the LOW_OPTIMAL_SIZE and HIGH_OPTIMAL_SIZE columns.

#Querying the V$SQL_WORKAREA_HISTOGRAM View: Percent Optimal
	The following query shows the percentage of times work areas are executed in optimal, one-pass, or multi-pass size since startup. This query only considers work areas of a certain size, with an optimal memory requirement of at least 64 KB:
		SELECT optimal_count, ROUND(optimal_count*100/total, 2) optimal_perc,

				 SUM(multipass_executions) multipass_count
			FROM V$SQL_WORKAREA_HISTOGRAM
		   WHERE low_optimal_size >= 64*1024);	


#The V$WORKAREA_ACTIVE view displays the work areas that are active (or executing) in the database instance. Small, active sort operations (under 64 KB) are excluded from this view. Use this view to precisely monitor the size of all active work areas and to determine whether these active work areas spill to a temporary segment.
