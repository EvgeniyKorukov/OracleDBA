# Parameter - PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET
	The amount of PGA memory is set to the value of PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET minus the amount of PGA memory allocated to other components of the system (such as PGA memory allocated by sessions)
	Divide the remaining available memory between the SGA and the PGA:
		For OLTP systems, the PGA memory typically makes up a small fraction of the available memory, leaving most of the remaining memory for the SGA.
			Oracle recommends initially dedicating 20% of the available memory to the PGA, and 80% to the SGA. Therefore, the initial value of the PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET parameter for an OLTP system can be calculated as:
			PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET = (total_mem * 0.8) * 0.2 where total_mem is the total amount of physical memory available on the system.
		For DSS systems running large, memory-intensive queries, PGA memory can typically use up to 70% of the available memory.
			Oracle recommends initially dedicating 50% of the available memory to the PGA, and 50% to the SGA. Therefore, the initial value of the PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET parameter for a DSS system can be calculated as:
			PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET = (total_mem * 0.8) * 0.5 where total_mem is the total amount of physical memory available on the system.
