#To enable automatic generation of PGA performance advice views:
	Set the PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET parameter to enable automatic PGA memory management.
		Setting this parameter to 0 disables automatic PGA memory management and is not recommended. For information about setting this parameter, see "Setting the Initial Value for PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET".
	Set the STATISTICS_LEVEL parameter to TYPICAL (the default) or ALL.
		Setting this parameter to BASIC disables generation of the PGA performance advice views and is not recommended.

#Using the V$SYSSTAT and V$SESSTAT Views
	#query of the V$SYSSTAT view that displays the total number and the percentage of times work areas were executed in these three sizes since the instance was started:
