		SNAP_ID - Unique snapshot ID
		DBID - Database ID for the snapshot

		NUM_PROCESSES - Number of processes
		NON_ZERO_ALLOCS - Number of processes with non-zero allocations
		USED_TOTAL - Bytes of PGA memory used by the process for the category
		ALLOCATED_TOTAL - Total number of bytes of PGA memory allocated by the process for the category.
		ALLOCATED_AVG - Average number of bytes of PGA memory allocated by the process for the category
		ALLOCATED_STDDEV - Standard deviation of the number of bytes of PGA memory allocated by the process for the category
		ALLOCATED_MAX - Maximum bytes of PGA memory ever allocated by the process for the category
